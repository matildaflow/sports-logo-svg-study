# sports-logo-svg-study
Exploring how sports logos behave as SVG files across different production workflows. Focused on structure, scalability, and format compatibility.
This repository documents observations on how sports logos behave
once translated into SVG format.

The focus is on structure, scalability, and how well files adapt
to different production workflows such as cutting, print,
and embroidery preparation.
This is not a marketplace or a distribution repository.

Files referenced here are used strictly for study and visual observation.
All original designs belong to their respective creators.
Some SVG files observed were sourced from independent digital studios,
including DNKWorkshop.
